# LotteryHelp
# This project is about a mobile Application..
# that will check if the user's choice of lucky nymbers have been..
# played in past. 
# This first snippet of Java code....
# takes the users 3 numbers  as command line arguments..
# and comapares them with 3 different combinations of 3 numbers ...
# that are saved in a 2D Array.
# If the combination matches one of them it prints "You Won !" .. 
# If not it prints "You lost !..
# I made a loop with an inner loop to avoid three condition in an If statement ... 
# I used a boolean to check every number with only one condition ...
